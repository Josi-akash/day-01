        <h3>Childhood and family:</h3>
        <p>
          <i> Elon Reeve Musk</i> was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of
          South Africa's capital cities. Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
          ancestry. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and
          dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.
          His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer,
          pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a
          Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a younger brother,
          Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.

        <h3>Business career:</h3>
        <p>
          In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Errol
          Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding. The company developed an
          Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and
          marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in
          Palo Alto, Musk coding the website every night. Eventually, Zip2
          obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.
          The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with
          CitySearch; however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.
          Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, and
          Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.
